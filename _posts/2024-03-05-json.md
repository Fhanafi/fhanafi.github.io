## Fake API from JSON Server 

When developing frontend applications, you often need a quick and easy way to mock REST APIs. `json-server` is a great tool for this purpose. It allows you to create a full fake REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds.

## Installing JSON Server

To get started with `json-server`, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Once you have those set up, you can install `json-server` globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

## Creating a Mock Database

`json-server` uses a simple JSON file to act as your database. Create a file named `db.json` and add some sample data:

```json
{
  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "Hello World", "author": "John Doe" },
    { "id": 2, "title": "Learning JSON Server", "author": "Jane Smith" }
  ],
  "comments": [
    { "id": 1, "postId": 1, "body": "Great post!" },
    { "id": 2, "postId": 1, "body": "Very informative." }
  ],
  "profile": { "name": "Admin" }
}
```

## Running JSON Server

With your `db.json` file ready, you can start the `json-server`:

```bash
json-server --watch db.json
```

By default, `json-server` will run on port 3000. You can now access your mock API at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Exploring the Endpoints

`json-server` automatically generates routes for your data. Based on the `db.json` file, you can access the following endpoints:

- `GET /posts` - Retrieves all posts
- `GET /posts/1` - Retrieves the post with ID 1
- `POST /posts` - Creates a new post
- `PUT /posts/1` - Updates the post with ID 1
- `DELETE /posts/1` - Deletes the post with ID 1

Similarly, you can access the `comments` and `profile` endpoints.

### Example Requests

#### GET Request

Retrieve all posts:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/posts
```

#### POST Request

Create a new post:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "New Post", "author": "Alice"}' http://localhost:3000/posts
```

#### PUT Request

Update a post:

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Updated Post", "author": "Alice"}' http://localhost:3000/posts/1
```

#### DELETE Request

Delete a post:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/posts/1
```

## Advanced Features

`json-server` also supports many advanced features such as:

- **Custom routes:** You can define custom routes in a `routes.json` file.
- **Middlewares:** You can add custom middlewares to extend the functionality.
- **Static file server:** Serve static files along with your API.

### Custom Routes

Create a `routes.json` file to define custom routes:

```json
{
  "/api/": "/",
  "/posts/:id/show": "/posts/:id"
}
```

Start the server with the custom routes:

```bash
json-server --watch db.json --routes routes.json
```

### Adding Middleware

To add middleware, create a `server.js` file:

```javascript
const jsonServer = require('json-server');
const server = jsonServer.create();
const router = jsonServer.router('db.json');
const middlewares = jsonServer.defaults();

// Add custom middleware before the default middlewares
server.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request method:', req.method);
  next();
});

server.use(middlewares);
server.use(router);
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('JSON Server is running');
});
```

Run your custom server:

```bash
node server.js
```
